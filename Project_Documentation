Set up Express.js for handling routes.
Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose.

Models and Schemas
Define schemas for User, Transaction, Category, and Savings Goal.
Use Mongoose to create models.

Authentication
Implement user registration and login routes.
Use bcrypt for password hashing.
Implement JWT for secure authentication.

API Endpoints

Test API endpoints with Supertest.
Frontend Testing

Write unit tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library.
Implement end-to-end tests with Cypress.

5. Deployment

Backend Deployment

Deploy the backend on a platform like Heroku or DigitalOcean.
Use environment variables for sensitive data.
Frontend Deployment

Deploy the frontend on a platform like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
Ensure the app is built and optimized for production.
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment.

6. Maintenance and Iteration

Collect user feedback and monitor usage.
Fix bugs and improve performance.
Plan and implement new features based on user needs and feedback.
This structured approach will help you build a comprehensive and robust Personal Finance
Tracker application.
